# MIT Todo List Application

## App Information

### Title: MIT Simple ToDo List

### Description

This assignment consist on building a todo list with React, using the state hooks and function components. The application handles the add, delete and rush functionalities. If the todo is marked as rush by clicking on the "circle" button, it will add different styles and add it to the top of the list. As well, it handles historical data by not completely removing the todo item, but instead marking as isDeleted and not showing in the UI. This approach allows expansion of the application, by adding "Done Todos" section, where it will show all these items.
